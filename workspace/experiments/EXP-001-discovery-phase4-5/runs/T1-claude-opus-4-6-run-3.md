## Operator input

```
/discovery — The payment operations team processes ~40,000 card transactions per day. When a payment fails due to a transient error (e.g. network timeout, issuer unavailable), the current system does not retry — it marks the payment as failed and drops it. The merchant is not notified in real time. Operations engineers discover failures during a manual triage shift (2–3 hours/day) by reading raw error logs. Around 8–12 payments per shift are retryable failures that were silently dropped. Each dropped payment creates a manual reconciliation task and a potential merchant complaint.
