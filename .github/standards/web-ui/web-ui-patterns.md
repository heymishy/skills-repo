# Web UI Patterns — Skills Platform Server

<!-- Applies to all features that add routes, handlers, or session logic to src/web-ui/ -->

## Injectable adapter pattern (D37 / ADR-009)

Any new capability that makes a model call or external I/O call from a route handler MUST be implemented as an injectable adapter. Three things are mandatory — not optional:

### 1. Stub default MUST throw

```js
let _myExecutor = () => {
  throw new Error('Adapter not wired: _myExecutor. Call setMyExecutorAdapter() with a real implementation before use.');
};
```

Do NOT use a stub that returns `null`, `undefined`, `''`, or any other safe-looking value. Silent stubs let the flow complete incorrectly with no error and no diagnostic signal.

### 2. Setter exported from the route module

```js
function setMyExecutorAdapter(fn) { _myExecutor = fn; }
module.exports = { ..., setMyExecutorAdapter };
```

### 3. Production wiring in `server.js`

The wiring must be an explicit, separate task in the implementation plan — not bundled with the handler task. After wiring, confirm with:

```js
const { setMyExecutorAdapter } = require('./routes/skills');
setMyExecutorAdapter(realModelCallFn);
```

A DoR AC must verify the wiring is present: "The adapter is wired to a real implementation in `server.js` and the wiring is verified by a test or smoke check."

## Session token access

**`req.session.accessToken` is the canonical field name** for the GitHub OAuth token on all web UI routes.

- Never use `req.session.token` — it is not populated by the OAuth callback.
- DoR grep check (must return zero results): `grep -rn "req\.session\.token[^A]" src/web-ui/`

---

## Silent fallback — three-path test coverage requirement

Any route that implements a silent fallback (primary call fails → fall back to static/default, no error shown to operator) MUST have test coverage for all three failure modes:

1. Executor **throws** an error
2. Executor **returns an empty string** (or equivalent falsy value)
3. Executor **returns `null`**

Each failure mode must assert:
- The response is a redirect or the next page (not an error page)
- The fallback content (static question, default text) is served

One test per failure mode — three separate test cases, not one.

---

## Progress display invariant

When a UI flow presents `Question X of N` or equivalent progress indication, `N` MUST be derived from the static/template source, not from any dynamically-generated content.

- Reason: model output may be shorter or longer than the canonical list; operators need a stable completion signal.
- Applies to: question count, section count, any other step-count UI.
- See ADR-019 in `.github/architecture-guardrails.md`.

## Stack constraints

- No new npm `dependencies` — Node.js built-ins only (same constraint as wuce.26)
- No Express — raw `http.createServer` only
- All session state via `req.session.*` — no cookie-based auth outside the OAuth callback handler
