# Story def-s1 — Skills session resume: restore turns and artefact from Redis on page load

**Feature:** 2026-07-03-skills-session-resume
**Epic:** N/A (short-track defect)
**Track:** short-track (bug fix)
**Status:** Definition
**Complexity:** 2
**Scope stability:** Stable

## Defect summary

When a user navigates directly to a `/skills/:skillName/sessions/:id/chat` URL after a server restart or Fly.io deploy, they receive a 404 "Session not found" page. The session IS durably persisted in Redis (via `skill-session-redis.js`) — it is not lost — but `handleGetChatHtml` in `src/web-ui/routes/skills.js` checks only the in-memory `_sessionStore` and returns 404 immediately if the session is absent, without attempting a Redis restore.

The consequence: users lose access to their in-progress skill session (turns and partial artefact) on every server restart. On Fly.io this happens on every deploy. The session data is safely in Redis and recoverable — the handler just never tries.

A secondary gap: once the page loads (same server instance, session still in `_sessionStore`), `session.turns` and `session.artefactContent` are served from memory correctly. The Redis restore path must replicate this, restoring both `turns` (conversation history → rendered as prior Q&A pairs) and `artefactContent` (partial skill output → rendered in the artefact panel).

## Metric linkage

- **M1** (Self-serve signup conversion — indirectly): A broken session resume forces users to restart skill sessions from scratch, degrading the experience and increasing drop-off before artefact completion. This fix is a prerequisite for M1 reaching a measurable baseline on the landing-auth-billing feature.

## User story

As a platform user with an in-progress skill session,
I want navigating to my session URL (e.g. after a browser refresh or a server deploy) to reload my prior conversation and partial artefact,
So that I never lose in-progress skill work due to a server restart.

## Root cause

`handleGetChatHtml` (`src/web-ui/routes/skills.js`, ~line 3569):

```js
var session = _sessionStore.get(sessionId);
if (!session) {
  // returns 404 — no Redis restore attempted
}
```

The Redis restore functions (`readSessionFromRedis`, `registerHtmlSession`, `mergeRedisSessionData`) already exist and are used by `handleGetJourneyResume` in `journey.js` (lines 1191-1197), but are not called from the standalone skills chat handler.

## Acceptance criteria

**AC1** — Redis restore on cache miss: session URL loads (200) when session absent from `_sessionStore` but present in Redis
Given a user navigates to `/skills/:skillName/sessions/:sessionId/chat`,
And the sessionId is NOT present in the in-memory `_sessionStore` (e.g. after server restart),
And the sessionId IS present in Redis (returned by `readSessionFromRedis`),
When `handleGetChatHtml` executes,
Then the handler calls `registerHtmlSession` then `mergeRedisSessionData`, populates `_sessionStore`, and serves the chat page with HTTP 200.

**AC2** — 404 preserved for genuinely unknown sessions
Given the sessionId is NOT in `_sessionStore` AND `readSessionFromRedis` returns null (not in Redis),
When `handleGetChatHtml` executes,
Then the handler returns 404 "Session not found" (existing behaviour preserved).

**AC3** — Prior conversation turns restored with current question shown and no restart
Given AC1 holds (Redis restore occurred),
And the session has N completed turns (e.g. question 3 of 10 through /ideate: turns = [A1, U1, A2, U2, A3]),
When the rendered chat page HTML is inspected,
Then:
(a) The N-1 answered Q&A pairs (e.g. Q1/A1, Q2/A2) are rendered in `#chat-messages` as prior history messages,
(b) The last unanswered assistant question (e.g. Q3) is rendered as the current prompt — the user sees where they left off, ready to answer,
(c) `thread.children.length > 0` so the client-side auto-fire guard (`if(thread.children.length === 0) sendTurn("__init__")`) does NOT trigger — the skill does NOT restart from question 1.

**AC4** — Prior artefact content restored
Given AC1 holds (Redis restore occurred),
And the session had a non-null `artefactContent` at the time of the last Redis write,
When the rendered chat page HTML is inspected,
Then `window.__SW_INITIAL_ARTEFACT__` is set in the inline script (artefact panel shows the prior draft).

**AC5** — Journey panel renders correctly after Redis restore
Given AC1 holds (Redis restore occurred),
And `redisData.journeyId` is non-null (the restored session was linked to a journey),
When the rendered chat page HTML is inspected,
Then `session.journeyId` is set on the restored session so the journey navigator and gate-confirm panel render correctly.

**AC6** — No regression: sessions already in `_sessionStore` are unaffected
Given the sessionId IS present in `_sessionStore` (normal in-process path),
When `handleGetChatHtml` executes,
Then the handler serves the chat page exactly as before — no change in behaviour, no additional Redis reads.

## Out of scope

- `handleResumeSession` API (`GET /api/skills/:name/sessions/:id/resume`): this uses the separate `src/session-store.js` durable store and is a distinct flow used by the sessions list page. To be addressed separately if needed.
- Journey resume path (`handleGetJourneyResume` in `journey.js`): already implements Redis restore; no change required.
- Session migration or data backfill: Redis writes are fire-and-forget after every turn; all sessions written since `skill-session-redis.js` was deployed (feature `2026-06-20-skill-session-precomp`) are already available in Redis.
- UI changes: the fix is entirely in the server-side handler; the rendered HTML is unchanged.

## Implementation touchpoints

- `src/web-ui/routes/skills.js` — `handleGetChatHtml` (line ~3569): add async Redis restore before the 404 branch. Pattern:
  1. `var _redisData = await readSessionFromRedis(sessionId);`
  2. If `_redisData`: call `registerHtmlSession(sessionId, _redisData.sessionPath, _redisData.skillName, { featureSlug: _redisData.featureSlug })` to create an in-memory session with a fresh system prompt
  3. Call `mergeRedisSessionData(sessionId, _redisData)` to restore `turns`, `artefactContent`, `journeyId`, etc.
  4. Re-read `session = _sessionStore.get(sessionId)`
- `tests/web-ui/skills-session-resume.test.js` (new): unit tests for AC1–AC6

## Architecture constraints

- `registerHtmlSession` is a synchronous function and `readSessionFromRedis` is async — `handleGetChatHtml` is already `async`; no await chain changes needed.
- `mergeRedisSessionData` requires the session to already exist in `_sessionStore` (it reads from there) — call order is: `registerHtmlSession` FIRST, then `mergeRedisSessionData`. Reversing the order will produce a no-op merge.
- Redis data does NOT include `systemPrompt`, `contextFiles`, or `precomputedStep1` (stripped by `COMPACT_STRIP` in `skill-session-redis.js`). `registerHtmlSession` rebuilds these from the skill SKILL.md. This is correct and expected.
- `_redisData.done === true` → `readSessionFromRedis` returns null (this check is already in `readSessionFromRedis` line 78). Completed sessions are deleted from Redis on completion. No handling needed for `done` case.
- Path traversal: `_redisData.sessionPath` comes from Redis (written by the server). It is server-originated, not user-controlled. The existing path traversal guard in `registerHtmlSession` (if any) covers this; no additional guard needed in `handleGetChatHtml`.

## NFRs

None — confirmed 2026-07-03. Performance and security constraints are captured in Architecture Constraints above (no extra Redis reads for hot path, graceful Redis unavailability, no credentials in Redis data) and verified by test plan IT1 and NFR1.

## Test

Tests live in `tests/web-ui/skills-session-resume.test.js`. The test injects a mock `_skillSessionRedis` adapter via `setSkillSessionRedisAdapter`. Required cases:
- AC1: mock Redis returns session data → 200 response, session appears in `_sessionStore`
- AC2: mock Redis returns null → 404 response
- AC3: session has turns [A1, U1, A2, U2, A3] → priorQA HTML for Q1/A1 and Q2/A2 present in response body; Q3 rendered as current question; no `sendTurn("__init__")` scenario (thread non-empty)
- AC4: session has `artefactContent` → `__SW_INITIAL_ARTEFACT__` present in response body
- AC5: session has `journeyId` → restored session has `journeyId` set
- AC6: session already in `_sessionStore` → 200, Redis adapter NOT called
