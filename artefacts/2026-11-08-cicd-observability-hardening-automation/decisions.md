**2026-11-08 | ASSUMPTION | discovery (/clarify)**
**Decision:** Build a new outbound Teams notification mechanism (an Incoming Webhook URL plus new code) for the chat-notification adapter, rather than reusing `approval-channel`'s existing HMAC/dispatch pattern.
**Alternatives considered:** Assumed reuse of the existing inbound HMAC/dispatch pattern (`src/approval-channel/adapters/teams-adapter.js`) would work for outbound sending too — this was the discovery draft's original assumption before /clarify.
**Rationale:** Read `teams-adapter.js` directly during /clarify. `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` authenticates *inbound* requests (verifies a signature on an incoming webhook) — it has no outbound-send capability and no credential usable for sending. Posting a message to a Teams channel requires a different mechanism (a channel Incoming Webhook URL, or the Graph API with OAuth app registration), which needs its own secret (per `product/constraints.md` #12, stored in a secrets store, never the agent's environment) and new code.
**Made by:** Claude Sonnet 5, confirmed by Hamish King (Platform Owner), during /clarify session, 2026-11-08
**Revisit trigger:** If Microsoft Teams later exposes a way to send messages using the same credential/mechanism as the existing inbound webhook (considered unlikely), or if this initiative's chat target changes from Teams to Slack/email.
